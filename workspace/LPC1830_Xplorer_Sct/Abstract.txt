@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use SCT to toggle its CTOUT pins
		when there is a match timer occur.
	Process:
		First, to install and understand how to integrated Fizzim auto generating
		C code file into Keil, please read ../tools/doc.
		
		This example serially set a SCT output pin high in a pre-programmed time.
		When counter reaches limit, this pin is set low, other pin is set high like:
		   All pin low -> CTOUT0 high -> CTOUT1 high -> CTOUT2 high -> CTOUT3 high
		-> All pin low -> CTOUT0 high -> ....
		
		So the *.fzm file will have:
		   - 5 states: 1 entry (all pin low), 4 other states for each CTOUTx pin high
		   - 4 output pins
		   - 1 input is the limit counter value. 
		Open the sct_simple_match.fzm for more detail.
		
		Imtegrate this fzm file and Fizim tool into compiler (Keil) and compile, burn
		then use oscilloscope to monitor CTOUT[0..4].
					
@Directory contents:
	Fizzim tools to translate *.fzm to C code. 
	\Keil: includes Keil project and configuration files 
	lpc18xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	Sct_SimpleMatch.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			Hitex LPC1800 Board
			
	Running mode:
		Internal SRAM mode:	This example can run on Internal SRAM mode.
					All files must be build to .elf file, this file will be loaded into Internal SRAM through a
					debugger tool before running
		Hitex Flash mode: 	All files must be built to .hex file before burn into flash
			+ This example can be run on external flash:
				* SST39X320X:
					- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
						a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
						   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
						b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 						
                SPIFI 64MB Debug mode:
			+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
					- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
						a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
						   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
						b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 
                SPIFI 128MB mode:
			+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
					- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
						a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
						   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
						b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD

	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on Hitex Flash mode)
		- Step 3: Run example and observe CTOUT[0...4] signals by oscilloscope
		
@Tip:
	- Open *.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
