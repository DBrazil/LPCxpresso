usbhid_rom
=====================
This project contains an HID USB example for the LPCXpresso board
mounted with an LPC1343 Cortex-M3 part. This example uses the USB
driver in on-chip ROM, simplifying the code and saving flash space.
To run this example, you must attach a USB cable to the board. See
the "Getting Started Guide" appendix for details.

When downloaded to the board and executed, the PC will recognize
a USB HID device. LPC1343 HID Demonstration.exe (in the project
directory) can be used to turn the LED on and off and toggle I/O
lines.

One thing we have seen that can cause trouble with the USB examples
is the Windows driver install. Since the example projects all use
the same USB Vendor ID and Product ID, if you try out the HID
example and then try out the Mass Storage example, Windows may try
to use the HID driver it had already installed with the Mass
Storage example code. To fix this, go to the Windows Device Manager,
find the broken "HID" device and select "Uninstall." Then unplug the
device and plug it back in. Windows should correctly identify the
device as being a Mass Storage Class device and install the correct
driver.

One thing that makes this project different from many of the other
ones is that 0x180 bytes at the beginning of RAM have been left
free for the ROM USB driver to use. It is important to use the
modified linker script usb_buffer_mem.ld and not to let LPCXpresso
re-generate the linker scripts automatically.

The project makes use of code from the following library projects:
- CMSISv1p30_LPC13xx : for CMSIS 1.30 files relevant to LPC13xx
- LPC13xx_Lib            : for LPC13xx peripheral driver files

These two library projects must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.
