@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to implement an simple web application 
	Process:
		This tiny web server was taken from the 'Design & Elektronik'
		extra issue 'Embedded Internet'. It can be downloaded from the 
		following web site: www.elektroniknet.de/extraheft. 

		This software was adapted to work with a LPC18xx Validation board and 
		the Keil RV ARM C-Compiler with as few modifications as possible. 

		Note that modifications are not optimal, because ARM is a 32-bit 
		machine while the original software was written for 16-bit cpu.

		The web page shows the values of two analog inputs (AN0 and AN1).
		This tiny webserver needs very little resources and therefore has
		some restrictions:
		- only one active TCP session at any one time
		- no support for fragmented IP datagrams
		- no buffer for TCP datagrams received in wrong order
		- only one web page. No GIF/JPG graphics possible.

		The IP address can be modified in the module tcpip.h to
		fit into your existing LAN (see MYIP_x). 
		The default IP address is: 192.168.0.100

		MAC address can be changed from emac.h file
		IP Address can be changed from tcpip.h file

		Note: check correct settings for jumpers according the board's manual

		Please order the extra issue 'Embedded Internet' of the 
		'Design & Elektronik' magazine for a technical description.
		It is only available in German language. 

@Directory contents:
	easyweb.c/.h: easy web application (Main program)
	EMAC.h/.c: LPC18xx EMAC hardware driver functions
	lpc18xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	Retarget.c: target-dependent low level functions
	tcpip.h/.c: implement TCP/IP stack functions	
	webpage.h: webpage html source
	
@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			LPC1830 Xplorer Board
		
						
	Running mode:
		Internal SRAM mode:	This example can run on Internal SRAM mode.
		SPIFI 32MB Debug mode:
			+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
					- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
						a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
						   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
						b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD						
					
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Use CrossOver cable to connect from your PC to ETH port on eval board
		- Step 3: Run Debug the board
		- Step 4: Open command prompt window, execute 'ping 192.168.1.123' command then wait until it replies
		- Step 5: Open web browser, access to address "http://192.168.1.123" to display the content
		           of webserver.
	
	Note: The application is designed to read the ADC channel 2 of ADC0, to be able to see the ADC values changes
	      we need to place the LPC830 Xplorer board on the NGX mx-baseboard and then turn the potentiometer on the base
		  board.
		           		
		(Pls reference "LPC18xx Example Description" document - chapter "Examples > EMAC > Easy_Web"
		for more details)
		
@Tip:
	- Open .\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
