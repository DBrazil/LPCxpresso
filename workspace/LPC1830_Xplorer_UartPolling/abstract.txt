@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use UART in polling mode
	Process:
		UART0/UART1 configuration:
			– 9600bps 
			– 8 data bit 
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 
			- Receive and transmit enable
		
		UART0/UART1 will print welcome screen first, then:
		 	- press any key to have it read in from the terminal and returned back to the terminal.
			- Press ESC to exit.
			- Press 'r' to print welcome screen menu again.
		
@Directory contents:
	\Keil:	includes Keil project and configuration files 	
	lpc18xx_libcfg.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	Uart_Polling.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			LPC1830 Xplorer Board
				
		Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			– 9600bps 
			– 8 data bit 
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 
			
				
	Running mode:
		Internal SRAM mode:	This example can run on Internal SRAM mode.
		SPIFI 32MB Debug mode:
			+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
					- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
						a) Copy all things in ..\..\..\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
						   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
						b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD 						

					
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART1->USB port on this board to USB port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example, use serial display to control UART0/UART1 as the guide on screen
		
		Note: The debug messages can be viewed on UART0 or UART1. This is configured by a Compile time switch in file 
      Uart_Interrupt.c under Uart_Interrupt folder. Please note to use UART0/UART1 you need to use an external RS232 converter, 
	  the LPC1830 Xplorer board has the UART0/UART1 at TTL level.
		
@Tip:
	- Open \Keil\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
